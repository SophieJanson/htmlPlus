      <h2>How to display background color?</h2>
      <p>The background-color property sets the background color of an element.

The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).

      <h2>What is a CSS declaration?</h2>
      <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

      <h2>What is a CSS property</h2>
      <p>When you write CSS properties, you cannot simply make them up as you see fit. For instances, "color" is an actual CSS property, so you can use it. This property is what determines the text color of an element. If you tried to use "text-color" or "font-color" as CSS properties, these would fail because they are not actual parts of the CSS language.
