      <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
      <p>A block element element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). <br>
      An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

      <h2>How do you make an element stick to the top of the screen?
</h2>
      <p>Using the sticky property value. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>
