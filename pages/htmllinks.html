      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Nice Job! We now have an HTML page with different tags. In this sections we are going to dive into hyperlinks. Links are pretty important in HTML, assuming that you obviously don't want to trap you users on one page. Links allow the user to navigate to different pages.

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML, links are added using <i>anchor</i> tags. Anchor tags usually contain an <i>href</i> attribute, which contains the link to which you would like to direct a user. An example is: <code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;LINK TEXT&lt;/a&gt;</code>.

      <h2>When?</h2>
      <p>
        Pink elephants are the best types of elephants. They are pink, they're massive and well... they are pink. Did you notice the nonsense here? Great! That means you're still paying attention. Also, you can use anchor elements to link to pages within your website or external page. In the first case, you can use relative links, in the latter case, you'll need to use the full links. More information about this is available <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks" target="_blank">here</a>.
