      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>In the previous section you learned about how to structure your HTML page. Now let's have a bit more of an in-depth look into HTML tags. Tags have a name, one or more attributes and content. Names tell the browser which kind of element you're looking at. Attributes provide information on how to render the tag to the user. The content, or inner HTML normally contains the information the user will read.

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        Let's disect the following <i>div</i> tag: <code class="html">&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Some header text&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. This tag creates a <b>div</b> element with an attribute <b>class</b>. The class element contains a value that allows you to recognize your element later on, so that you can add define how the element will look using <a href="#cssintroduction" target="_parent">CSS</a>.

      <h2>Fun fact</h2>
      <p>Did you notice that the <b>div</b> element contains another element inside of it? This is referred to as nesting. When creating HTML pages, it's common practice to nest HTML elements in order elements and even have elements inside those elements. For more information about how you can add many elements to your HTML file and nest them, have a look <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/nesting-html-tags-3466475" target="_parent">here</a>  .
