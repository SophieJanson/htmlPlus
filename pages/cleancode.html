  <h2>Clean Code</h2>
  <p> Clean code is code that is easy to read,
understand and maintain. Clean code makes
software development predictable
and increases the quality
of a resulting product.<p>

    <h2>What is Refactoring</h2>
    <p>  Refactoring is a type of changing code,
but has one major constraint that makes “changing code” an imprecise way to
describe it: you don’t change the behavior of the code.<p>
    <p>Refactoring is a controllable process of improving code
without creating new functionality. It transforms a
mess into clean code and simple design.

  <div class="explanation">
    <h2>Refactoring Process</h2>
    <p> Performing refactoring step-by-step and
running tests after each change are key
elements of refactoring that make it
predictable and safe. It should be done as a series of small changes, each of which makes the existing code slightly better while still leaving the program in working order.<p>
</p> Checklist of refactoring done <i>right way</i>
  <ul>
<li>The code should become cleaner.</li>
<li>New functionality should not be created during refactoring.</li>
<li>All existing tests must pass after refactoring.</li>
</ul>
