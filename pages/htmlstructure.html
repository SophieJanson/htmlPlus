        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>Webpages are built using HyperText Markup Language, which is commonly referred to as HTML. <b>HTML</b> is a markup language, which means that it is used to “mark up” the content within a document, in this case a webpage, with structural information that tells a browser how to display a page. When an HTML document is loaded by a web browser, that browser uses the HTML tags that have marked up the document to render the page’s content.

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>In essence, your HTML page will be a collection of different tags. Most tags have opening and closing tags, some (like image tags) are self-closing, which means they don't have a closing tag.
      <p>HTML pages typically have the following main elements: the <b>head</b> and the <b>body</b>. The <b>head</b> is not visible to the user, but contains a lot of information that tells the browser how to render your HTML page. The <b>body</b> contains all HTML elements that are shown to your user.</p>
